### Insights & Thoughts

1. Use of thinly chopped or sliced lemon instead of vinegar in pickles for flavour, preservation and taste enhancement. Home made vinegar can be preferred. Outside amchur powder or market vinegar can be avoided by using 1-2 lemons in any pickle. _2022-03-15_
2. Vegetables used in curries must be good combinations for pickles as well, such as gaajar methi. Will try. _2022-03-15_
